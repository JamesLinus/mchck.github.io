We are happy to be able to announce the first prototype MC HCK dev
kits.  These prototype kits are meant for early adopters, who would
like to evaluate and verify the electrical design of the MC HCK, and
those who want to contribute to the growing software library.

#+HTML: <!-- more -->

During the past months of silence, several things have ripened to
usefulness:

We've created a bootloader that allows firmware updates via USB; this
means that the MC HCK can be programmed without additional programming
adapters.  This also confirms that the MC HCK is definitely usable in
its most basic form.

Additionally, using our custom SWD toolchain, it is possible to debug
code on the MC HCK using gdb.  The toolchain currently supports the
Bus Blaster and Bus Pirate boards as SWD adapters, but native
MC HCK <-> MC HCK SWD debug support is underway.



The prototype kits will come in parts (not assembled) and will contain
the following components:

- 5x MCU (pre-programmed with USB bootloader)
- 5x boards (2.0 mm, direct USB pluggable)
- 1x discretes for all parts
- 2x NRF24L01+ RF board
- 2x MCP73831T-2ACI LiPo charger IC
- 2x 180mAh LiPo battery
- 2x W25Q80BV 1MB SPI flash
- 1x MIC5205-3.3 16V LDO
- 1x LM3671MF-3.3 buck IC
- 1x TPS61097-33 boost IC
- 2x Micro-USB AB receptacles
- 3x 32.768kHz RTC XTAL

This allows you to build 5 standard MC HCKs, and run RF
communications, autonomous nodes, log large amounts of data, and run
from a variety of power sources.  Not all of these options have been
verified to work yet, but that's what this prototype kit is for.

The price of the prototype kit will be $60, and will include PayPal
fee and international shipping, either from Switzerland or the
European Union (your choice).  The total cost calculation can be found
at [[https://github.com/mchck/mchck/wiki/Prototypes][Prototypes]].

To get to this price level, we need to purchase parts for 50 kits, and
also sell 50 kits.

This is where we need your support:  We need 40 brave supporters, who
will commit to buying each a prototype kit (ask your friends and
hackspace!), and ideally transfer the money ahead of time.  Simon is personally
prepared to eat the cost for up to 10 kits, should we not manage to
find 50 buyers.

Due to IC factory lead times, we expect the kits to ship end of August.

If we don't get to at least 40 kits within one month, we will refund
all payments.

Thanks for your continued interest and support!
