From the beginning, the MC HCK was conceived to be not only cheap to
produce and sell, but it was also conceived to be buildable at home,
at a low cost.  In this post, we'll show how to build a MC HCK at
home.

** Getting the Parts
All required and optional parts are listed in the [[https://github.com/mchck/mchck/wiki/BOM][BOM]].  Let's quickly
go over how to get the required ones.

*** PCB
The MC HCK boards can easily be ordered from the [[http://imall.iteadstudio.com/open-pcb/pcb-prototyping/im120418001.html][usual]] [[http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/fusion-pcb-service-2-layers-p-835.html][suspects]] in
China.  Just download the [[https://github.com/mchck/mchck-board/tree/fab][fabrication gerbers]] and attach them to your
order; usually you will have to create a zip file.  Now wait 10 days
or so until your PCBs arrive. /Cost: $10 + shipping for 10 boards/

*** MCU
You can [[http://www.freescale.com/webapp/search.partparamdetail.framework?PART_NUMBER=MK20DX128VLF5&buyNow=true#Ordering_Information][sample]] a compatible MCU directly from Freescale. /Cost: $5 for 5 MCUs./

*** Passives
These are common parts, and many people will already have them in some
way or another.  The SMT parts are 0603 size, but the pads are large
enough to take 0805 parts as well.  In case you're still missing one
or the other part, below is a list of possible eBay sources:
