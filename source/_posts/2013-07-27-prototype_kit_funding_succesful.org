/This text is a adapted version of what has been mailed to the
prototype supporters./

Thanks to all supporters for ordering a MC HCK prototype kit and
supporting the project!  The funding has been successful: almost all
kits have been sold.

There are a few things that will help make the MC HCK a success:

#+HTML: <!-- more -->

First, please subscribe to the MC HCK mailinglist to follow the
progress of the prototype order, and to exchange ideas and feedback
for the MC HCK.  The mailing list is extremely low volume.  Go to
<https://0x2c.org/mailman/listinfo/nerds> to sign up.  Best do it now
and then continue reading the email.


Second, if you bought a prototype kit, please make sure that you
received a mail from me and that your shipping address mentioned in
the mail is correct.

Third, a short status update;  unless something big happens, I will
not email buyers with further updates.  Subscribe to the mailing list if
you would like updates.

I have already received most parts for the kits, but some are on
backorder.  The backorder is currently estimated to arrive on Sep 21,
2013, but DigiKey's estimation has been slipping.  I am thinking about
getting these parts from a different distributor.


Thanks again to everybody for supporting the MC HCK project, and
thanks for subscribing to the mailing list and contributing your
ideas!
