Given that we are still waiting for components for the prototype kit,
I used the opportunity to do another design iteration.  The new design
features (hopefully) improved analog noise performance, and a
rearranged pin layout that allows to use the nRF24L01+ RF boards
directly on SPI.

During the coming weeks, I will do a post series explaining the
gimmicks and features of the MC HCK.
