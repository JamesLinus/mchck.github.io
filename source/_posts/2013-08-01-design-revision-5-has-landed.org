Given that we are still waiting for components for the prototype kit,
I used the opportunity to do another design iteration.  The new design
features (hopefully) improved analog noise performance, and a
rearranged pin layout that allows to use the nRF24L01+ RF boards
directly on SPI.

As usual, you can look at the [[https://github.com/mchck/mchck/wiki/Schematic-and-layout][schematics and design on the wiki]] or
[[https://github.com/mchck/mchck-board/tree/fab/hardware][access the fabrication outputs]] directly.

During the coming weeks, I will do a post series explaining the
gimmicks and features of the MC HCK.
