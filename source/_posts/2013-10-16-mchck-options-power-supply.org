The MCU used on the MC HCK already contains a 3.3V linear regulator
that allows operating from the 5V that are provided by USB.  But not
every MC HCK will always be connected to USB -- we have several power
supply options to cover these cases.

At the heart of the additional power supply options is a 3-way voltage
regulator footprint that can host an LDO, a step-down converter, and a
step-up converter.

#+HTML: <!-- more -->

A part of this 3-way regulator is the dual footprint of the output
inductor /L1/: depending on the regulator setup used, either the left
or the right side get populated.  All of these options require
breaking the trace in /D3/, which by default bridges /VRAW/ to the 5V
from USB.

** Linear Regulator: up to 16V
[[/images/options-power-ldo.jpg]]

This one uses a [[http://www.micrel.com/_PDF/mic5205.pdf][Micrel/Exar 5205 SOT-23-5 linear regulator]] that can
operate at up to 16V.  It runs at a low idle current of 100µA.

*** Build
- D3 :: break trace
- U4 :: SPX5205
- L1 /right/ :: 0R SMT jumper
- C11, C12 :: 4.7µF, 16V, 2012 chip capacitor

** Step-Down Converter

The [[http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm3670.pdf][National/Texas Instruments LM3670 step-down converter]] in SOT-23-5
will operate at up to 5.5V at very low idle current of 15µA in
low-load PFM mode.  This configuration is great for using a single
LiPo cell or three AAA batteries - it should reach efficiency of over
90% for 1mA load at 3.7V.

*** Build
- D3 :: break trace
- SJ5 :: bridge
- U4 :: LM3670MF
- L1 /right/ :: 4.7µH, 200mA, 2012 chip inductor
- C11, C12 :: 10µF, 6.3V, 2012 chip capacitor

** Step-Up Converter
[[/images/options-power-boost.jpg]]

The [[http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps61097-33.pdf][Texas Instruments TPS61097]] or [[http://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX1722-MAX1724.pdf][Maxim MAX1724]] SOT-23-5 step-up
converter will work down to 0.9V, at only 5µA idle current.  This
setup is ideal for operation off one or two alkaline batteries.

Even though the MC HCK itself can operate directly from a single
Lithium coin cell, auxiliary parts might require a higher voltage;
this power option is also useful for these cases.

*** Build
- D3 :: break trace
- SJ5 :: bridge
- U4 :: TPS61097
- L1 /left/ :: 4.7µH, 200mA, 2012 chip inductor
- C11, C12 :: 10µF, 6.3V, 2012 chip capacitor
