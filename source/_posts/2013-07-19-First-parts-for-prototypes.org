Everything is progressing smoothly with the prototypes!  We've sold
40 prototype kits so far, which means that this undertaking will
really happen.

Today, the first parts for the kits arrived:

#+HTML: <!-- more -->

DigiKey already shipped all parts that are not on backorder.  The
stacks of LiPo batteries on the left, the bag of RF modules on the
right, and the cute QFP48 programming adapters in front came from
China using a TaoBao agent, which worked out nicely as well.

I realized that I forgot some Schottky diodes for running the LiPo
batteries on USB input, and some ferrite beads for experiments in
reducing ADC noise -- I'll add those to the outstanding DigiKey order.

The parts on backorder at DigiKey are:
- the MCUs (already in their stock)
- reset/programming buttons (expected Aug 29)
- boost converters (first est. Sep 4, now expected Sep 15)

What's missing, besides antistatic + bubble bags (which are ordered),
are the PCBs.  I have decided to open a patch window for now, given
that we are waiting on parts anyways.  That means we can do some last
changes to the design and layout, do a small prototype run using
SeeedStudio or iTeadStudio, and still get the PCBs made in time.

If anybody has some not-too-intrusive suggestions for layout change,
now would be the time to speak up.  Next opportunity will be after
the prototype run when we collect experiences and feedback.

I have two changes I want to look into:
- move the ferrite beads from the power input section to the analog
  supply lines of the MCU
- allow operation from LiPo without Schottky diode
