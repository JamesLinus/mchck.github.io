#+DRAWERS: REQUIREMENTS

* Homepage migration
** TODO check all links

* New content
** TODO pin assignment picture
** TODO describe options
*** General Layout /o
- staggered pads
- layout goals
  - short ground loops
  - design rules: can be fabbed in china
  - quiet analog section (see later post)
  - pack as much functionality as possible
- mounting hole

**** General Layout /o and Layout Goals
***** Staggered Pads
This design idea comes from [[https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/114][Pete at SparkFun]].  Putting the pads
slightly offset of center allows a light friction lock, which
simplifies soldering of pin headers.


***** Mounting Hole
Perfect to bolt down your MCÂ HCK with a M3 (#4 or #5) screw; enough
bottom side clearance to use a hex standoff.  Or just string a thread
through it and hang it off somewhere.

***** Layout Goals
- Home solderable :: Use TQFP instead of QFN, use 1610 parts, slightly
     enlarged pads
- Design rules :: can be produced by Chinese budget PCB fabs
- Good layout practice :: short ground loops, quiet analog section



*** Power options
- 3-way voltage regulator
  - linear
  - buck
  - boost
- VRAW + USB diode

*** LiPo
- LiPo charger
- charge status pad
- disable charge with PROG = high/float
- jst connector

*** Analog section
- ferrite beads
- VREF
- C9/SJ4 combo footprint
- measure noise?

*** Crystal options
:REQUIREMENTS:
- [X] ADC lib for temperature
- [ ] clock calibration code
- [ ] EEPROM lib for storage
:END:
- internal resonator good enough for USB (measure)
- high freq osc (integrated caps)
- RTC pads

*** USB
- (main) USB A connector
- (secondary) USB micro AB connector
- USB header (cut tab)
- solder jumpers

*** SPI flash
- double footprint

*** nRF24l01 board compat
- SPI dual allocation

*** debugging/programming
XXX what is this about?

*** Software library
- VUSB
- provide efficient application API, instead of accessing hardware
- linker scripts
- makefile infrastructure

** TODO soldering video
